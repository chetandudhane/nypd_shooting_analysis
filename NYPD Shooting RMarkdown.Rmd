## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document for reproducing NYPD shooting data analysis


## 1. Importing data

#### 1.1 Load the library `tidyverse`
``` {r load_tidyverse, echo=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
```
<br>

#### 1.2. Load dataset from the url
``` {r import_url, echo=TRUE}
url_in = "https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/833y-fsy8/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD"
nypd = read_csv(url_in)
head(nypd)
```
<br>

## 2. Overview of the data
``` {r overview}
glimpse(nypd)
summary(nypd)
```

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis
<br>

#### 3.1 Deleting location co-ordinate columns. We dont need it for this analysis
``` {r}
nypd = nypd %>%
  select(-c(X_COORD_CD:Lon_Lat))
```

<br>

#### 3.2 Changing date column to `date` type
``` {r}
library(lubridate)
nypd = nypd %>%
  mutate(OCCUR_DATE = mdy(OCCUR_DATE))
```

<br>

#### 3.3 Check for missing values in each column
``` {r}
missing_values <- nypd %>% 
  summarise_all(~sum(is.na(.)))
glimpse(missing_values)
```

<br>

#### 3.4 Deleting columns with high number of missing values

- Following columns have a very high number of missing values:
  - LOC_OF_OCCUR_DESC
  - LOC_CLASSFCTN_DESC
  - LOCATION_DESC
  
- Hence, deleting these columns from our analysis as they dont add any insight
<br>

```{r}
nypd = nypd %>%
  select(-c("LOC_OF_OCCUR_DESC", "LOC_CLASSFCTN_DESC", "LOCATION_DESC"))
```

<br>

#### 3.5 Overview of the final dataframe, which we will use for analysis
```{r}
summary(nypd)
```

<br>

## 4. Visualisations

<br>

#### 4.1 Distribution of Incidents over time

- Lets visualise the number of incidents over time

```{r}
library(scales)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(zoo)  # For calculating the moving average

# Calculate the average number of incidents
average_incidents <- nypd %>%
  count(OCCUR_DATE) %>%
  summarise(avg = mean(n)) %>%
  pull(avg)

# Calculate the moving average
nypd_moving_avg <- nypd %>%
  count(OCCUR_DATE) %>%
  mutate(moving_avg = rollmean(n, k = 7, fill = NA, align = "right"))  # 7-day moving average

# Plot the number of incidents over time
nypd %>%
  count(OCCUR_DATE) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = OCCUR_DATE, y = n)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "green") +  # Add regression line +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "12 month", date_labels = "%b %Y") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = average_incidents, linetype = "dotted", color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Number of Incidents Over Time", x = "Date", y = "Number of Incidents")


```

- We notice 2 main spikes in incidents:
  - First in 2011-12
  - But the highest spike in 2020-21

- Horizontal dotted red line denotes - Average number of incidents over the years, which is around 5

**- Modelled Regression Line**

  - Dark green line is the modelled Regression line of the data set
  
  - It shows a negative trend of incidents from 2006 to 2024
  
  - This shows that crime rate in New York is declining

<br>

#### 4.2 Incidents by Borough

- Lets look at incidents by Borough

<br>
```{r}
# Plot incidents by borough
nypd %>%
  count(`BORO`) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(`BORO`, n), y = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  geom_text(aes(label = n), hjust = 1.1, color='white') +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Number of Incidents by Borough", x = "Borough", y = "Number of Incidents") +
  theme_light()
```
<br>

- We note that Brooklyn has the highest number of incidents in NY, followed by Bronx

- Staten Island has the lowest crime rate

<br>

#### 4.3 Incidents by Precinct

- Similar to Borough, lets identify which precint has the highest number of incidents reported

<br>
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

nypd %>%
  count(`PRECINCT`) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  slice_head(n=25) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(`PRECINCT`, n), y = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  geom_text(aes(label = n), hjust = 1.3, color='black', fontsize=5) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
  labs(title = "Number of Incidents by Precinct (Highest 25)", x = "Precinct", y = "Number of Incidents") +
  theme_light()
```

<br>

- Precincts with highest reported incidents are:
  - Precincts 75, 73 and 67

- Not in the visual, but Precincts with lowest reported incidents are:
  - Precincts 22, 17 and 111

<br>

#### 4.4 Incidents by Month - Seasonal trends

- Lets plot incidents by month of the year to identify if there are any seasonal trends to incidents

<br>
```{r}

# Extract month
nypd <- nypd %>%
  mutate(month = lubridate::month(`OCCUR_DATE`, label = TRUE))

# Plot incidents by month
nypd %>%
  count(month) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = month, y = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Number of Incidents by Month", x = "Month", y = "Number of Incidents")
```
<br>

- June, July, Aug are the months of highest crime rate in NY
- Maybe, because its a good weather period in NY and there are more people stepping out, It would be interesting to explore more on this thought.

<br>

#### 4.5 Incidents by Hour of the day - Daily trends

- Let us plot the number of incidents during every hour of the day to find the most unsafe times and the safest times of the day.

```{r}
library(lubridate)

# Extract hour
nypd <- nypd %>%
    mutate(hour = hour(`OCCUR_TIME`))


# Plot incidents by time of day
nypd %>%
  count(hour) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = hour, y = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Number of Incidents by Time of Day", x = "Hour of the Day", y = "Number of Incidents")

```
<br>

- As expected, most incidents occur during the night, peaking at around midnight.
- The safest time as per the data, is from 5 am till around sunset.

<br>

#### 4.6 Victim profile

- Lets check the victim profile in the shooting incidents

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

nypd %>%
  count(`VIC_SEX`) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  #slice_head(n=25) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(`VIC_SEX`, n), y = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  geom_text(aes(label = n), hjust = 1.3, color='black', fontsize=5) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
  labs(title = "Victim Profile - Sex", x = "Victim Sex", y = "Number of Incidents") +
  theme_light()
```
<br>

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

nypd %>%
  count(`VIC_RACE`) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  #slice_head(n=25) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(`VIC_RACE`, n), y = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
  geom_text(aes(label = n), hjust = 1.3, color='black', fontsize=5) +
  labs(title = "Victim Profile - Race", x = "Victim Race", y = "Number of Incidents") +
  theme_light()
```
<br>

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

nypd %>%
  count(`VIC_AGE_GROUP`) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  #slice_head(n=25) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(`VIC_AGE_GROUP`, n), y = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
  geom_text(aes(label = n), hjust = 1.3, color='black', fontsize=5) +
  labs(title = "Victim Profile - Age group", x = "Victim Age Group", y = "Number of Incidents") +
  theme_light()
```


<br>

#### 4.7 Murder

- Let us see, how many shooting incidents resort to victims actually dying.
- This will show the intensity and type of shootings

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

nypd %>%
  count(`STATISTICAL_MURDER_FLAG`) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  #slice_head(n=25) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(`STATISTICAL_MURDER_FLAG`, n), y = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
  geom_text(aes(label = n), hjust = 1.3, color='black', fontsize=5) +
  labs(title = "Victim died or not?", x = "Murder?", y = "Number of Incidents") +
  theme_light()
```

## 5. Insight

<br>

  1. The borough which has the highest occurence of incidents is Brooklyn, followed by Bronx
  
  2. The borough with lowest incidences is Staten Island
  
  3. There was a big surge of incidences in 2020-21, maybe due to the hapless situations people were put in due to pandemic. Generally crime rates have remained quite steady. 
  
  4. Though Linear regression modeled on the data shows that there is a slight dip in incidences occuring over the years and it is predicted to keep going down
  
  5. Victim profile in these incidents mostly aligns with the following (in pure numbers). Victims are mostly:
      - Black and Hispanic males
      - in the age group of 18-44
      - They Mostly survive the shooting attacks.
  
  
  6. Highest incidences occur in the jurisdiction of Precincts 75, 73 and 67
  
  7. Precincts with the jurisdiction having lowest incident reports are 22, 17 and 111
  
  8. June, July and Aug have the highest reported incidences, while sundown till 5 am are the busiest times for crime


## 6. Bias

<br>

  1. This analysis is done on the dataset of NYPD shooting incidence reports filed, so all the biases related to any data collection will exist, like:

      1.1 **Measurement Bias** - Occuring from inaccurate collection of data or inaccurate methodologies used. 
      We have to assume that the data is collected from authentic source of real NYPD reports
  
      1.2 **Reporting Bias** - Occurs when certain outcomes are more likely to be reported than others. 
      We have to assume that the data was reported correctly. That is the officer filing the incidence report was thorough and correct about every parameter recorded
      
      1.3 **Selection Bias** - Occurs when the sample is not represenative of the population.
      If all data from all precincts is not collected or if only partial data from some precincts is reported to the dataset, then a lopsided analysis can occur
  
  2. **Personal Bias** - 

      2.1 There are many personal biases that can come across when analysing any data. 

      2.2 In this data, i tried to look at the overview first and details later to overcome any biases.

In conclusion, by acknowledging my biases and implementing diverse metrics, I aimed to ensure a balanced and thorough analysis. This approach helped me see the bigger picture and draw more accurate insights.
